## Governing Law; Disputes; Arbitration.

**Law.** These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions and the parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco county.

**Binding Contract.** You acknowledge that these Terms are a contract between you and Lark ORG, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Lark ORG, and it governs your use of the Site.

**Arbitration.** Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). You and Lark ORG expressly agree and intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. For purposes of this Section, "Claims" means collectively, and without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Site, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) your use of the Site.

**Informal Dispute Resolution.** If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Site or these Terms, other than as may be provided herein, then you and Lark ORG agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. Lark ORG notice to you will be sent based on the most recent contact information that you provided Lark ORG. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, Lark ORG has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and Lark ORG will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either you or Lark ORG to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which you and Lark ORG, in each of the parties' sole discretion, is not comfortable.

**Applicable Law.** If you and Lark ORG cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then you agrees that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to your use of the Site, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below. However, you and Lark ORG agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between you and Lark ORG regarding these Terms and the Site, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would. THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE SERVICE.

**Arbitration Request.** To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Lark ORG at 340 S Lemon Ave #4133, Walnut CA, 91789. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS's rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) as is mutually agreed upon. You can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS: 800.352.5267 and https://www.jamsadr.com.

**Fees.** You and Lark ORG will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Lark ORG to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Lark ORG will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Arbitration rules may permit Lark ORG to recover attorneys' fees. Lark ORG will not seek to recover attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

**Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND LARK ORG EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. You and Lark ORG each agree that such proceeding shall take solely by means of judicial reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 638.

**Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, you or Lark ORG may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights). You or Lark ORG may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a particular Claim, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You and Lark ORG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms or your use of the Site in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply. In such a case, should Lark ORG prevail in litigation against you to enforce its rights under these Terms, Lark ORG shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which Lark ORG may be entitled.

**Restrictions.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR LARK ORG WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR LARK ORG MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH HEREIN) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. "Commencing" means, as applicable: (i) by delivery of written notice as set forth herein; (ii) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth herein; or (iii) filing an action in state or federal court. This provision will not apply to any legal action taken by Lark ORG to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any losses (or potential losses) relating to the Site, intellectual property rights of Lark ORG, and/or Lark ORG's provision of the Site.

**Opt-Out.** You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: privacy@vercel.com with the subject line "COMPANY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT". The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Site, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes in accordance with these Terms providing for binding arbitration. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Lark ORG also will not be bound by them.
