# Lark CLI

## What is Lark CLI?

To customize most things when using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev), you can eject. However, you'll then need to maintain every configuration and script yourself, which can be a bit annoying. **Lark CLI**, which stands for **C**reate **R**eact **A**pp **C**onfiguration **O**verride, allows you to get all of the benefits of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) without ejecting. Customize your configurations ESLint, Babel, PostCSS, and many more with just a single configuration file at the root of your project.


By doing this you're breaking the ["guarantees"](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/99#issuecomment-234657710) that CRA provides. That is to say, you now "own" the configs. **No support** will be provided. Proceed with caution.
